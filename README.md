# Ember-apollo

(WORK IN PROGRESS) GraphQL for ember.js

### What is Apollo?
Apollo is Facebook Relay for things other than React. Read about it here http://dev.apollodata.com/

### Why use Apollo?
In the event you've jumped onto the ember-redux bandwagon, it's probably in your best interest to fully embrace the declarative method of data fetching.

### Is Apollo a replacement for ember-data
In the ideal world, yes, however, because Apollo forces GraphQL and in the real world, most APIs aren't GraphQL, there may be plenty of situations where the sheer extensibility and coverage of ember-data will prove superior.

Let's not go overboard with the religious wars, and instead use the right tool for the right job.
